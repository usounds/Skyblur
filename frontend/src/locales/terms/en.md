## Collection and Use of Personal Information
This Site does not collect personal information from users (hereinafter referred to as users) for the provision of services.

## Provision of Data to Third Parties
Unless otherwise provided by laws and guidelines, this Site will not provide users' personal information to third parties without consent.

## About Access Analysis Tools
This Site uses "Web Analytics," an access analysis tool by Cloudflare. This traffic data is collected anonymously and does not identify individual users.

## About External Services
This Site uses the following external services, which results in communication with each service. In addition, communication with the user's PDS will occur.

## About Data Retention Location per Visibility Scope
- Authentication information is encrypted and stored on this server.
- Public, Password, and Login-required posts are stored in the PDS.
- For Followers-only, Following-only, and Mutual-only posts, the blurred text is stored in the PDS, and the original text is stored on our proprietary server.
  - Backups are retained daily for 30 days, but the developer bears no responsibility for any data loss due to unforeseen circumstances. If this is not acceptable, please do not use the Followers-only, Following-only, or Mutual-only features.

## Attribution of Copyright
Copyright for all content posted on this Site by users belongs to the poster themselves. This Site only displays users' posts.

## Responsibility
Users bear all legal responsibility for their posts, and in the event of any issues, users shall resolve them at their own expense and responsibility.

## Prohibited Actions
If this Site confirms that a user has engaged in prohibited acts, the service may suspend the user's use, such as by disabling login, stopping new posts, or hiding posts.
- Infringing on the rights of third parties.
- Posting content that violates public order and morals.
- Posts intended primarily for interaction between users, rather than for posting blurred text or long-form content to be viewed by third parties.

## Other
- Part or all of the post is stored in the Bluesky PDS. If you wish to delete a post, please use the delete function on this Site yourself. Since information stored in the Bluesky PDS is public, Skyblur cannot be used for the purpose of absolute concealment.
- Even if the visibility scope is set to "Require login to view," login is required on this Site, but it is not guaranteed on other services.
- As this service is operated by an individual, the service may be suspended suddenly. Additionally, while we will consider addressing bugs and other issues as much as possible, we do not promise to do so.
- The terms of use of each PDS apply to information stored in the PDS, and these Terms of Use apply to information stored on our proprietary server. Additionally, Bluesky's Terms of Service apply to Bluesky's features.
- Follower, following, and mutual follow statuses use the API provided by Bluesky. Therefore, immediately after following/unfollowing, the status update may be delayed.
